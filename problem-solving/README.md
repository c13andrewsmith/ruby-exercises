Now let's practice creating our own classes in Ruby to solve problems.
Use the `touch` command in the Terminal to create Ruby files in the
`problem-solving/lib/` directory that match the `_spec.rb` files below. Remember
to name your files using `snake_case` and define your classes using `CamelCase`

Suggested Order of Completion

* `hello_spec.rb`
* `character_count_spec.rb`
* `escape_characters_spec.rb`
* `mad_lib_spec.rb`
* `simple_math_spec.rb`
* `retirement_spec.rb`
