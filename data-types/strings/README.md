The `strings_spec.rb` file in the `spec` folder has a number of exercises to help you better work with strings in ruby.

#What is Rspec?
RSpec is a computer domain-specific language testing tool written in the programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development framework which is extensively used in production applications. This Exercise Repository utilizes rspec to execute miniature tests to demonstrate the functionality of code that **you** will write!

In the Terminal, navigate to the `ruby-exercises/data-types/strings/spec/` directory, then type `rspec strings_spec.rb`. You can execute a file from a higher working directory by including the filepath, e.g. `rspec data-types/strings/spec/strings_spec.rb`.

Modify the code in `strings_spec.rb` so that each of the tests will pass successfully; change `xit` to `it` to see the results of a test instead of skipping it.

Below is a list of methods that will help you complete the exercises - research each of them on the [Ruby Docs for Strings](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/String.html) to learn more about what they do and how they are used.

There are additional methods that you will need to complete the exercises; each of these additional methods can be found in the Ruby Docs for Strings.
